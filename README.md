## What is this? :thought_balloon:

This is a personal project of mine, which I'm currently using as an opportunity to learn more about a full-stack workflow and developing a real app.

Codespark is an social network for students around the subjects of computer science and eletronics for peers to share their experiences, projects, tips and ideas.
