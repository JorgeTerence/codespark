## What is this? :thought_balloon:

This is a personal project of mine, which I'm currently using as an opportunity to learn more about a full-stack workflow and developing a real app. 

Codespark is an educational network for students around the subject of computer science. The intent is for on one day the app be deployed as a website and used by students on my school to share experiences, knowledge and techniques. I've often felt the need to share something exciting with my peers but didn't have the right medium. This is the way I hope to make a small change! :slightly_smiling_face:
